# Glitchy Pong v0

Welcome to the Glitchy Pong v0 repository! This project is a simple Pong game developed in Python using the Pygame library. It's primarily used for testing interactions with GPT-4, showcasing basic AI and game mechanics integration.

## Installation

To get started with Glitchy Pong v0, you'll need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Then, install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
Running the Game
To run the game, navigate to the directory containing the game files and run:

bash
Copy code
python pong.py
Make sure you're using the Python version that has Pygame installed.

Game Features
Basic Pong gameplay with two paddles and a bouncing ball.
Score tracking for each player.
Sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
Known Bug
There is a known issue where the ball might "phase through" the paddle under certain conditions. This is likely due to how collision detection is handled between frames when the ball's speed is relatively high compared to the frame rate. We are looking into more robust collision detection mechanisms to address this issue.
